# Image Detection Project to reduce Dependency to RFID Tag



## 🔧 Tech Stack Breakdown

A concise overview of the tools and libraries used in this project, organized by functionality.

## 🖼️ Frontend
- **Tool / Library**: React (with Axios)  
- **Purpose**: Upload image(Base64) to the backend server.

## ⚙️ Backend
- **Tool / Library**: Node.js + Express  
- **Purpose**: Handle API requests and routing.

## 🧠 Image Embedding
- **Tool / Library**: `@xenova/transformers` `Xenova/clip-vit-base-patch32` (CLIP Model)  
- **Purpose**: Convert uploaded image into a vector representation using a pretrained CLIP model.

## 🗃️ Storage
- **Tool / Library**: MongoDB  
- **Purpose**: Store both the original image link to db (Original Image stored in System) and its corresponding vector embedding.

## 🔍 Matching Algorithm
- **Tool / Library**: Cosine Similarity  
- **Purpose**: Measure similarity between image vectors for image matching and retrieval.

## System Design

- Frontend sends base64 image to backend.
- Backend:
   - Converts base64 → Buffer → saves to `uploads/` as file.
   - Passes buffer to CLIP → gets vector.
   - Saves:
      - imagePath: "/uploads/..."
      - vector: [...]
- For matching:
   - Receive base64 from frontend.
   - Get vector, compare against DB vectors using cosine similarity.
   - Return matching documents with imagePath.
- Frontend displays images using path like `http://your-server/uploads/1715862692-image.png`

## For Deploy the Project

- ```pm2 start ecosystem.config.cjs```
- create ecosystem.config.cjs file 
   - Add these content
      - 
```javascript      
module.exports = {
    apps: [
        {
            name: "faceAttendance_image_detection_backend",
            script: "app.js",
            // cwd: "D:/Saurabh/face_attendance_mern_app/deployedApp",
            interpreter: "node",
            env: {
                PORT: "8154",
                MONGODB_URL: "",
                DB_NAME: "",
                MSSQL_USER: "",
                MSSQL_PASSWORD: "",
                MSSQL_SERVER: "",
                MSSQL_PORT: "",
                MSSQL_DATABASE: "",
            }
